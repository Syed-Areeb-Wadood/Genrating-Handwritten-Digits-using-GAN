# Genrating-Handwritten-Digits-using-GAN

Tenserflow-keras implementation of a Generative adversarial Network for generating handwritten digits trianed via MNIST dataset (containing handwritten digits of 28x28 pixel size)
The architecture of the GAN contains a discriminator (trained on actual dataset for real images) and a Generator (which generates images and tries to fool the discriminator)
The output of the discriminator is a sigmoid layer whereas the ouput the Generator is a 28x28 pixels with pixel values normalised between 0 and 1 ( The input to the Generator is a 100 element vector of gaussain random numbers ) fed in the discriminator, The weights of the generator are updated depending on the performance of the discriminator, If the discriminator is fooled more the weights are updated less and vice-versa . Finally, the images generated are evaluated for smoothness and realness by taking a sample of real dataset and taking a sample generated by generator and comparing the classification accuaracy of the discriminator model on both.
